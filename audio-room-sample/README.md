## Audio Room Sample

![image](../previews/cover-sample.png)

[The following tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/android/tutorial/audio-room/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Jaewoong_OSS&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_Mar2024_Jaewoong_Android_Samples&utm_term=DevRelOss) shows you how to quickly build an Audio Room app leveraging Stream's Video API and the Stream Video Android components. The underlying API is very flexible and allows you to build nearly any type of video experience.

This tutorial will teach you how to build an audio room experience like Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse. The end result will look like the image below and support the following features:

- Backstage mode. You can start the call with your co-hosts and chat a bit before going live.
- Calls run on Stream's global edge network for optimal latency and scalability.
- There is no cap to how many listeners you can have in a room.
- Listeners can raise their hand, and be invited to speak by the host.
- Audio tracks are sent multiple times for optimal reliability.

Before running and building this project, you can check out the [How to build guidelines](../how-to-build.md).
