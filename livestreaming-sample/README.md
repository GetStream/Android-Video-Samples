## Livestreaming Sample

![image](../previews/cover-sample.png)g

[The following tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/android/tutorial/livestreaming/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Jaewoong_OSS&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_Mar2024_Jaewoong_Android_Samples&utm_term=DevRelOss) shows you how to quickly build a Livestreaming app leveraging Stream's Video API and the Stream Video Android components. The underlying API is very flexible and allows you to build nearly any type of video experience.

In this tutorial we'll quickly build a low-latency in-app livestreaming experience. The livestream is broadcasted using Stream's edge network of servers around the world. We'll cover the following topics:

- Ultra low latency streaming
- Multiple streams & co-hosts
- RTMP in and WebRTC input
- Exporting to HLS
- Reactions, custom events and chat
- Recording & Transcriptions

Before running and building this project, you can check out the [How to build guidelines](../how-to-build.md).
